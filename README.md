# FastAPI Text-to-Speech Application Using Coqui TTS

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and steps for creating a FastAPI application that provides a text-to-speech (TTS) service using the Coqui TTS model. The application will accept text input via an API endpoint and return synthesized speech in audio format.

## Requirements

### Software Requirements

1. **Python 3.7 or later**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your machine.

2. **FastAPI**
   - Web framework for building APIs with Python.

3. **Coqui TTS**
   - The text-to-speech model for generating audio from text.

4. **Uvicorn**
   - ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.

### Libraries

The following Python libraries will be required:

- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`
- `coqui-tts`

### Hardware Requirements

- A machine with sufficient processing power to handle TTS model inference (preferably with a GPU for faster performance, if using a heavy model).

## Installation Steps

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   - Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - Activate the virtual environment.

   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and Coqui TTS.

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn coqui-tts
   ```

## Application Structure

### Main Application File

- Create a file named `app.py` to define the FastAPI application and TTS endpoint.

### API Endpoint

- **POST `/synthesize/`**
  - **Request Body:**
    - `text`: The text string to be converted into speech (string).
  - **Response:**
    - Returns an audio stream of the synthesized speech in WAV format.

## Running the Application

- Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application.

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

- The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Testing the API

- You can test the API using tools like Postman, curl, or by creating a simple HTML form to send requests.

## Example Request

Using `curl`, you can test the TTS functionality as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/synthesize/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello, this is a text-to-speech test."}'
```

## Conclusion

This document serves as a guide for creating a FastAPI application that integrates with the Coqui TTS model for text-to-speech synthesis. Ensure you have the necessary software and hardware requirements before proceeding with the implementation.
